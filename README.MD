#Test application

#### front-end part https://github.com/julius1986/TestTaskFront

Tech stack:  
- Back-end - <strong>mongoose, express</strong>
- Front-end - <strong>react, redux</strong>

##### Have to create a small application form for an event. The form should contain fields listed below:
- First name (required)
- Last name (required)
- Email (required, valid email address)
- Event date (required, simple date picker)

##### Requirements:
- The frontend should be written in React (using Redux will be very appreciated)
- Data from form should be saved in DB (we suggest MongoDB)
- Data from form should be validated before saving
- Errors should be handled and displayed for the user
- The app must be tested
